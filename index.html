<h1>Buffalo Bill's Accomplishments</h1>
<h2>How it all started</h2>
<p class="preamble">It all started when Cody when in the army and was going to a military outpost by horse
. When he got there, he noticed that it did not at all look like a military outpost, and in fact, looked more like a smalll town.
Its pomp and parades got Cody intrigued about plays, and soon, he tried to collaborate with various
people to try and get his business off of the ground, as he was trying everything to try and earn some
money to support his family.<img src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/KnkAAOSwwVBbkcUg/s-l300.jpg" alt="Ads" width="500">
