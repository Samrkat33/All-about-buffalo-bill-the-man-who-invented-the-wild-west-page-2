<h1>Buffalo Bill's Accomplishments</h1>
<h2>How it all started</h2>
<p class="preamble">It all started when Cody when in the army and was going to a military outpost by horse on a May day in 1869
. When he got there, he noticed that it did not at all look like a military outpost, and in fact, looked more like a smalll town.
Its pomp and parades got Cody intrigued about plays, and soon, he tried to collaborate with various
people to try and get his business off of the ground, as he was trying everything to try and earn some
money to support his family.<br><img src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/KnkAAOSwwVBbkcUg/s-l300.jpg" alt="Ads" width="500">
</p>
<p class="ending">Soon, he got famous celbrities to join his show, such as expert marksmen and markswomen, expert horse riders who 
could pick up an object off the ground going at full speed, and even some Natives that needed an actual translator.
There were a lot of Natives who wanted to sign up because even if they got a negative response from the audience, they
were happy that they could escape the government's plan to eradicate the Native American culture and replace
 it with English speaking Christians. He even went international many times, and went to Britain to perform in front of the Queen herself
 on May 11, 1887. At this point, all of America knew what the Wild West show was and even Britain knew what it was too and both of them 
loved the performance. Some famous celebrities watched it upwards of 20 times, which was an incredible response for an American show in 
Britain. He and the cast made lots of money, had a lot of fun, and most of all, learned from each others cultures. For me, it was incredible 
watching Cody's life unfold and take turns to become the person he known as today, who is the inventor of the Wild West. Some movies and novels
 today are greatly influenced by this show, and I think that is amazing because all of this, which happened almost 150 years ago, is still
 very relevant in our society today.</p>
